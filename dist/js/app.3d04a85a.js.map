regardless of place and time. This process is different from the traditional training method, which requires a direct relationship between a trainer and a trainee in a specific place and at specific times within courses that are prepared in advance.\n                  With the pace of technological progress, many companies and professional individuals specialize in online training. There has been a rise in the number of training applicants who prefer to enroll in important courses from their homes and offices instead of traveling to attend the courses that complement their businesses.\n                </div>\n              </div>-->\n              <div :id=\"data0.slug\" class=\"widget-text pt-2 mb-80\" v-html=\"data0.body\"></div>\n\n              <div :id=\"data1.slug\" class=\"pt-4 mb-60\">\n                <div class=\"widget-online-training mb-60\">\n                  <div class=\"wot-details\" :style=\"{backgroundColor:`${data1.bgColor} !important`}\">\n                    <div class=\"title text-uppercase\">{{ data1.title }}</div>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class=\"wot-view\" :style=\"{backgroundImage:`url(${data1.image})`}\"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"description-about\" v-html=\"data1.body\"></div>\n                <!-- <div\n                  class=\"description-about\"\n                >We provide a training provider and trainer accreditation service to those who provide this kind of important training in all of its forms, whether online, digital, or distance learning, due to the importance and benefit of this education as one of the training types in the world.
